I'm a PhD student interested in quantum circuit electrodyncamics applied to high precision measurments and the quantum computing stack. 

Prior to Yale, I worked at Google Quantum AI on processor architecture design and simulations using quantum processors, and at Princeton I worked on semiconductor spin qubits.
